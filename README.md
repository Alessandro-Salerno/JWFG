# JWFG
 JWFG (Java Wireframe Graphics) is a CPU-Rendering program created for a school assignment in 2022. 

 Its goal was to display both 2D and 3D wireframe scenes using OpenGL-like primitives built on top of Java Swing

 The porject was discontinued basically immediatelly after its inception, but it's kinda cool so...
